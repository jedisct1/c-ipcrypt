# IPCrypt (portable C implementation)

A portable C implementation of ipcrypt, a 32-bit block cipher that can
be used to "anonymize" IP addresses in log files.

The cipher was designed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson.

Reference implementation in Python: [ipcrypt](https://github.com/veorq/ipcrypt).

# ipcrypt 2

2025 Update: This project has been deprecated in favor of [ipcrypt 2](https://github.com/jedisct1/ipcrypt2), which is AES-based and supports IPv6 and non-deterministic encryption.
